Hi, I'm Du Phan &mdash; a Vietnamese researcher with a PhD in Mathematics and Data Science from POSTECH, South Korea. I work at the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and Bayesian statistics &mdash; and more recently, I’ve been exploring how probabilistic methods can push large language models (LLMs) even further.

This blog is where I share things I'm learning or thinking about &mdash; not polished tutorials, just ideas in progress. I’ve also built a few small sites along the way to share lessons I picked up while contributing to open-source projects.

I've learned a lot from free resources online, so this is my way of saying thanks &mdash; and maybe sparking something for others too.

When I'm not writing code or chasing ideas, you'll find me playing flute, chess, badminton, or lately, tennis.
