My name is Du Phan. I got my PhD in Mathematics and Data Science from [POSTECH](http://postech.ac.kr/eng/), South Korea. I have a deep interest in machine learning, deep learning, and recently Bayesian statistics. Having learned a lot from free resources on the internet, I hope that with this blog, I can contribute my knowledge back to the community.

My hobbies include playing flute, chess, and badminton.
