      "Note that every harmonic function has continuous partial derivatives of all orders. Suppose $uv$ is harmonic, which means $(uv)_{xx}+(uv)_{yy}=0$ in $\\Omega$, hence $u_xv_x + u_yv_y = 0$ in $\\Omega$ (because $u_{xx}+u_{yy}=0$ and $v_{xx}+v_{yy}=0$). Suppose more that both $u$ and $v$ are not constant. Put $g = u_x - iu_y$ and $h = v_y + iv_x$. It is plain that $g$ and $h$ are holomorphic in $\\Omega$ by checking their Cauchy-Riemann equations. If $Z(h) = \\Omega$, then $v_x=v_y=0$ in $\\Omega$. Let $D$ be any disc in $\\Omega$ such that $\\bar{D}\\subset \\Omega$. Then $v$ is a real part of a holomorphic function $V$ in $D$. By $V' = v_x - iv_y$, we have $V'=0$ in $D$, hence $V$ is constant in $D$ (for any $z,w$ in $D$, we have $V(z)-V(w) = \\int_{[z,w]}V'(\\zeta)\\,d\\zeta=0$), hence $v = \\operatorname{const}$ in $D$. This argument shows that for any $z\\in \\Omega$, $v$ is constant in some neighborhood of $z$. Pick $z_0 \\in \\Omega$. Now, it is easy to see that the set $\\{z\\in \\Omega: v(z) = v(z_0)\\}$ is both closed and open in $\\Omega$, hence is exactly $\\Omega$ by the connectedness of $\\Omega$. This means that $v$ is constant in $\\Omega$, a contradiction with our assumption. So $Z(h)$ must have no limit point in $\\Omega$. Put $k = g/h$, we have $k$ is a meromorphic function in $\\Omega$.

      "There does not exist any nonempty open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$. So $k$ is constant in each disc in which $g$ has no zero (by the open mapping theorem). Now, fix $a\\in Z(h)$. Let $r>0$ such that $D(0;r)\\subset \\Omega$ and $h(z)\\neq 0$ for every $z$ in $D'(0;r)$. Then we have $k$ is constant in each of four discs $D(a+r/2;r/2)$, $D(a+ir/2;r/2)$, $D(a-r/2;r/2)$, $D(a-ir/2;r/2)$. Because the first disc intersects with the second, the second intersects with the third, and the third intersects with the fourth, we conclude that $k$ is constant in the union of these four discs, hence is constant in $D(a;r/2)$ because $D(a;r/2)$ is a subset of this union. So $a$ is a removable singularity and $k$ is constant in the neighborhood $D(a;r/2)$ of $a$. By the connectedness of $\\Omega$, we get $k$ is constant in $\\Omega$. Denote this constant by $C$. By $(*)$, $C\\in \\mathbb{R}$, $C\\neq 0$ (if not, $u_x=u_y=0$ in $\\Omega$, hence $u$ is constant), and $u_x = Cv_y$, $u_y = -Cv_x$. We get the answer for the first question. Now, if $u^2$ is harmornic in $\\Omega$, then, as above, we have $u$ is constant or $u_x = Cu_y$, $u_y = -Cu_x$ for some real constant $C\\neq 0$. The second case leads to $u_x = u_y = 0$ in $\\Omega$, which also implies $u$ is constant. We affirm the second statement. (A simpler way to get this affirmation is that we take the Laplacian of $u^2$ and get $u_x = u_y =0$.) For the last question, put $f = u + iv$. Because $f\\in H(\\Omega)$, we have $u$ and $v$ are harmonic in $\\Omega$. Now, $|f|^2$ is harmonic iff $u^2 + v^2$ is harmonic. Take the Laplacian of $u^2+v^2$, we get $u_x = v_x = u_y = v_y =0$.

If $u$ is constant, then $v^2$ is harmonic (because $u^2-v^2$ is harmonic), hence  $v$ is constant by Excercise 1. Similarly for the case $v$ is constant, we conclude than $f$ is constant if $u$ or $v$ is constant, hence both $f$ and $\\bar{f}$ is holomorphic. Suppose $f$ is not constant.

      "Now, it is elementary to find the maximum of the right hand side, which is attained when $z$ is one of the middle points of the edges $ab$, $bc$, and $ca$.

The derivative of $l^2t^2-t^3$ according to $t$ is $(2l^2-3t)t$, which is greater than or equal to $0$ when $t$ ranges over $[0,l^2/4]$. So $t\\sqrt{l^2-t}$ is increasing when $t$ runs from $0$ to $l^2/4$, and the maximum is attained when $t = l^2/4$, which is the case $x = l/2$. $\\Box$\n",

By applying the maximum modulus theorem, if $|f^{-1}|$ has a local maximum then $f^{-1}$ must be constant, hence $f$ is constant. So $f$ has no local minimum on $\\Omega$. (For more details, we consider the case $f$ is not constant. Clearly $|f|$ has local minima at zeroes of $f$. Reversely, let $a$ be a point at which $f$ has a local minimum. If $a \\neq 0$, then $f\\neq 0$ in an open neighborhood of $a$. As above, $f$ must be constant in this neighborhood, hence be constant in $\\Omega$.

Together with the case $f$ is a constant, we see that $f$ must be in the form $cz^{m}$, where $|c|=1$ and $m\\geq 0$.

By the Schwarz reflection principle, we get a function $F \\in H(\\Theta)$ such that $F=f$ on $\\Omega\\cup L$.
